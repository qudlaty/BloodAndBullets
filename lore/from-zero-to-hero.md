You are a lonely gun-for-hire living and working around a spaceship scrapyard.
You spend time hanging around a local bar, called Fusion Five, buying and selling guns, ammo, energy cells and occasional artifact.
Every day new ships are towed into the scrapyard for dismantling, or some old ships are taken out of the scrap pile.
Every now and then you get a chance for a contract: 

- To "assess level of threat" on a given ship. 
- To clear a ship hulk of any life, inhabitants or infestation. 
This requires verifying that every corner of the ship is safe to work in. 
Clients will need bioscan and video feed logs for the scrapyard's Work Safety Audit Department.
(You'll get an WSAD scanner/recorder) 

When you gain enough reputation, you get more complex contracts, like 
- Assist a crew in their mission aboard an infested vessel (escort mission).
- Extract a particular piece of tech from a vessel that a salvage drone cannot.
- Plant a particular device somewhere on the vessel. Don't ask what it is. 
- Fly with a crew to a ship outside the scrapyard to perform any of the above. 
Turns out this is actually a boarding mission and you are not getting paid enough for this.

This is Season One of the story. Can be presented as a campaign.
In Season Two you'd get a chance to be recruited to a military or paramilitary boarding crew.
