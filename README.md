It introduces multiple mechanics making the deadly game of on-board spaceship
combat full of tactical possibilities.

- Bleeding targets leave blood on the floor when they withdraw. Blood sticks to boots/wheels/tracks/appendages, making traces, allowing you to track and hunt wounded prey. You can also examine how fresh the blood is, to determine whether given track is still relevant to your hunt.
- Heat mechanics and thermo-vision allowing you to detect heat signatures of the enemy crew, heat traces of their past positions and heat-producing parts of the ship.
- Fluid mechanics allowing you to flood levels, disperse flammable liquids, or put fires out with water.
- You can start fires to burn your enemies or deny them access to certain area.
- Motion tracker, detecting micro-changes in air density, allowing you to detect objects that are moving or even just breathing outside of your field of view.
- Nightvision to see in darkness.
- Long range scans and precision fire support from your mothership - MF-42 "Ishikawa".
- Grenades to throw around corners - HE, Shrapnel, Thermobaric, White Phosphorus, Chemical
- Smoke grenades to cover your advance.
- And many more for you to discover...

## History

At first it was a project to create a flat space-game,
then we've switched that to a React-based square-board game,
that will involve emoji-based heroes fighting aliens on the grid.

Heroes are expected to have a set of properties, inventories, equipment.

There will be bullets and there will be blood.
