# BloodAndBulllets

At first it was a project to create a flat space-game,
then we've switched that to a React-based square-board game,
that will involve emoji-based heroes fighting aliens on the grid.

Heroes are expected to have a set of properties, inventories, equipment.

There will be bullets and there will be blood.

### Environment set up

To have sass support on Windows, you will need to install windows-build-tools first.

Run PowerShell as an Administrator and then:

`npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`

After that you can just `npm install` and SASS should be working.
