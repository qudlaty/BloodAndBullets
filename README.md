# BloodAndBulllets

At first it was a project to create a flat space-game, 
then we've switched that to a React-based square-board game,
that will involve emoji-based heroes fighting aliens on the grid. 

Heroes are expected to have a set of properties, inventories, equipment.

There will be bullets and there will be blood.
